Files
--------------
* Function files 
1. hCGintensity2Dfunctionbacksubtracted (main processing function to process raw image quantitative analysis for hCG staining)
2. process_r_g (processing function to process raw image for total nuclei count)
----------------
* Script file
1. hCGonly (main script file to run the code)
----------------

*Instructions: 
- Keep all 3 files in same location
- Only change hCGonly file 
Lines 8-11 of “hCGonly”  are the only ones you should change

- When using Matlab, file location is very important
Right click, “Copy address as text”
- All experimental images need to be under the same umbrella file
